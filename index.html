          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive</li>
          <li>HTML attribute defines additional information about an element</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage users. Contains import info about accessibility, search engines, and performance</li>

     <ul>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>Inline CSS - used for styling an element directly in the HTML file</li>
       <li>Internal Style Sheet - Embeds an entire style sheet directly in the HTML file using style and head</li>
       <li>External CSS - the most common wya to style a webpage, allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file. Developers use a link element placed in the HTMLs head</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue includes the CSS property color and the value for the property, blue.</li>
       <li>rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
       <li>href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. Th href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location. To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css</li>
       <li>Write new declarations for a new CSS rule by designating a Class Attribute as the selector. This allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
       <li>.card - the period before card designates this as s class selector, any element assigned to the class card, will gan these property assignments</li>

     <ul>

       <li>-A flag indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
       <li>Pull command to receive a branchs modifications into the local environment</li>
       <li>Origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be the GitHub repo</li>
       <li>Main keyword indicates the branch, in this cases the main branch from the GitHub repo</li>
       <li>Push command pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>
       <li>Git command must precede every git statement</li>
       <li>IDE - Integrated development environment </li>
       <li>IDE is a software used by developers that combines many of the features needed by developers to do their work in a single interface GUI</li>
       <li>IDE contains essential tools for code development such as a source code editor, local build automation</li>
       <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
       <li>Repository (repo) is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored</li>
       <li>Branch is a workspace in which you can make changes that will not affect the live site</li>
       <li>Markdown (.md) is a way to write in GitHub that converts plain text to GitHub code. Sites such as Atom and Sublime Text are examples of free resources for developers using Markdown</li>
       <li>Commit Changes is a saved record of a change made to a file within the repo</li>
       <li>Pull Request (PR) - the way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch that also allows for multiple users to see, discuss and review work being done</li>
       <li>Merge is after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from branch to another and then, deployed on the live site.</li>
       <li>Issues is how work is tracked when using git. Issues allow users to report new tasks and content fixes, as well as allows users to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project.</li>
       <li>Federalist is a platform that surely deploys a website from a GitHub repository un minutes and lets users preview proposed and published changes</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
       <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
       <li>for loop used to operate on each element in an array</li>
       <li>var keyword declares a variable</li>
       <li>console.log method outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument. In this case console.log will output the value of topics to the web console because we’ve added it as an argument inside the parentheses.</li>
       <li>Control flow - the order in which a computer executes a code in script</li>
       <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
       <li>if statement is a way of introducing decision making into our code</li>

       <li>Starting point for our for loop var x = 0;</li>
       <li>Second statement is a condition, as long as the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. Use the length built in array property on our shapes array to express that condition x < shapes.length;</li>
       <li>Final statement is what allows the array to iterate each time. Code x++ is the same as x+1 so every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
